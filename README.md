# Mexico-City-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that predicts the price of apartments in Mexico City based on their size. The notebook uses a linear regression model.

The notebook first explores the relationship between apartment prices and size using descriptive statistics and visualizations. It then splits the data into a training set and a test set. The linear regression model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.

The results show that the linear regression model can predict apartment prices with a mean absolute error of $1100 USD. The model also shows that larger apartments tend to have higher prices.

The notebook also includes a section on communicating the results of the analysis. This section includes the model equation, the model intercept and coefficient, and a visualization of the model.

To use the notebook, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

matplotlib
pandas
numpy
seaborn
sklearn
Once you have installed the required libraries, you can open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
